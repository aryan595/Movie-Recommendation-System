    This is our primary, advanced model. It's a deep learning network that learns complex, non-linear patterns in user behavior.
    - **How it works:** It creates dense "embedding" vectors (like a personality profile) for every user and movie, then uses neural layers to predict ratings.
    - **Pros:** Higher accuracy, captures subtle user tastes.
    - **Cons:** Slower to train, more of a "black box" in its decision-making.

    This is our baseline, traditional model. It's a classic matrix factorization technique used for collaborative filtering.
    - **How it works:** It decomposes the giant user-movie rating matrix into two smaller matrices, effectively finding latent features.
    - **Pros:** Much faster to train, easier to understand.
    - **Cons:** Lower accuracy, as it can only capture linear relationships.

st.success(f"""
The data clearly shows that the **Neural Network model is the superior choice for accuracy**. It achieved a significantly lower RMSE ({ncf_rmse:.3f}) and MAE ({ncf_mae:.3f}) compared to the traditional NMF model.

While the NMF model trains much faster, the substantial gain in predictive accuracy justifies the longer, offline training time required for the Neural Network. This data-driven comparison validates the selection of the Neural Network as the primary engine for our AI-powered recommendation system.
